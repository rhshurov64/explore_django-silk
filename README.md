Explored django-silk for Advanced profiling and monitoring the performance of Django application.

Django Silk is a profiling and monitoring tool for Django applications. It helps to analyze and optimize the performance of a Django project. The tool tracks things like database queries, request/response times, and other key metrics, making it easier to find and fix performance bottlenecks in a project.

# Key Features of Django Silk
1. SQL Query Analysis: Tracks and displays SQL queries executed during requests, with details like query time and whether it was cached.
2. Request Profiling: It can log request/response times for better insights into how long each part of the request cycle takes.
3. Profiling Views: You can monitor the performance of views in your Django project and see how much time is spent in each view.
4. Cache Monitoring: It allows you to monitor the cache hit/miss ratios and how long it takes to fetch cached data.
5. Detailed Reports: Provides a dashboard that displays all collected profiling data, making it easier to spot potential bottlenecks.


# Why Use Django Silk?
1. Optimize Performance: With Silk, you can identify inefficient database queries, unoptimized view functions, or slow responses.
2. Database Query Monitoring: It helps you track database queries, showing which queries are taking too long and need optimization.
3. Visual Reports: Silk provides detailed reports and dashboards, making it easy to understand your app's performance at a glance.
